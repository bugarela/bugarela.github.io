I'm Gabriela, and I work with *programming languages* and *formal
methods*.

My *main project* right now is [[https://quint-lang.org][Quint]] ✨, a specification
language based on TLA+, on which I get to work full-time as a research
engineer at [[https://github.com/informalsystems/][Informal Systems]] 👩‍💻.

I'm very passionate about the tools that I use: NixOS, Emacs and XMonad. My
config files are all [[https://github.com/bugarela/dotfiles][here]]. I also like purple a lot.

I hold a *master's degree* 🎓, and both my [[https://github.com/bugarela/bachelor-thesis][bachelor's thesis]] (Portuguese) and my
[[https://github.com/bugarela/masters-dissertation][master's thesis]] (English) are about TLA+ tools, compiled in a project called [[https://github.com/bugarela/tla-transmutation][TLA
Transmutation]], with prototypes that generate Elixir code and tests from TLA+
specifications.

Aside from TLA+, I have a background in *static analysis*, which
constitutes most of my daily work right now. My very first paper was in
*type systems*: [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3264637.3264644][Type inference for GADTs, OutsideIn and anti-unification]]. You can check my
Haskell implementation of some type inference algorithms:
- [[https://github.com/bugarela/tipos][Hindley-Milner]]
- [[https://github.com/bugarela/OutsideIn][OutsideIn]]
- [[https://github.com/bugarela/GADTInference][OutsideIn with anti-unification]]

All of these are things that I'm very interested in and I continually get to
share them with my friends at the *[[https://github.com/funcao][Função]] Research Group* 💜. As of 2024, I'm also
teaching formal methods as a temporary lecturer at UDESC.

I'm Brazillian, I love it here, and you can find me sunbathing somewhere from
December to February (yes, that's summer ☀️). I'm also a cat owner 🐈 and casual
gamer 🎮 (currently playing World of Warcraft).
